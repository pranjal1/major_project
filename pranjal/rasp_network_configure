1. images are transfeered using scp protocol which uses ssh protocol.
2. command
   from pi to computer(server)
	scp -r path_to_file_in_RPi server_name@192.168.0.110:path_in_server
   from computer to pi
	sudo scp path_to_file pi@ip_of_RPi:path_in_RPi
3. I have made my computer IP static 192.168.0.110
4. scp requires password each time, to remove need for password, public and private keys can be used.

5.STEPS to generate public and private keys:
  type in RPi terminal:
  ssh-keygen -t rsa

  this will generate a private key and a public key named:
    id_rsa -->private key
    id_rsa.pub -->public key

6.Save the public in default location in default location by hitting return.
/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa

7.leave password empty by hitting return two times as prompted.

8.transfer the id_rsa.pub to remote machine (server) using
scp -r /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub server_name@192.168.0.110:/home/pranjal/.ssh/authorized_keys2

9.now you should be able to transfer the files without hitting passwords.
